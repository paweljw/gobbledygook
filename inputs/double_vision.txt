Feelin' down and dirty, feelin' kind of mean
I've been from one to another extreme
It's time I had a good time, ain't got time to wait
I wanna stick around till I can't see straight

Fill my eyes with that double vision
No disguise for that double vision
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me
My double vision gets the best of me

Never do more than I, I really need
My mind is racing, but my body's in the lead
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna push it to the limit
I'll live all of my years in a single minute

Fill my eyes with that double vision
No disguise for that double vision
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me
My double vision always seems to get the best of me, the best of me, yeah

Ooh, double vision, I need double vision
It takes me out of my head, takin' me out of my head
I get my double vision
Oh, seeing double double
Oh, I have double vision, yeah, I'm getting double vision
